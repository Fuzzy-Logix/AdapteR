\title{Perform matchit algorithm in database.}
\usage{
matchit(formula, data, method = "nearest", distance = "logit",
  distance.options = list(), discard = "none", reestimate = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{This argument takes the usual syntax of R formula,
‘treat ~ x1 + x2’, where ‘treat’ is a binary treatment
indicator and ‘x1’ and ‘x2’ are the pre-treatment covariates.
Both the treatment indicator and pre-treatment covariates must
be contained in the same data frame, which is specified as
‘data’ (see below). No operators in formulas are currently
supported in AdapteR.}

\item{data}{This argument specifies the data frame containing the
variables called in ‘formula’. Either a FLTable or prepared
data in a deep table.}

\item{method}{(for API compatibility with MatchIt, must be
nearest)}

\item{distance}{(for API compatibility with MatchIt, must be
logit)}

\item{distance.options}{(for API compatibility with MatchIt,
ignored)}

\item{discard}{(for API compatibility with MatchIt, must be none)}

\item{reestimate}{(for API compatibility with MatchIt, not
supported)}

\item{...}{additional arguments. Can be the following:
\itemize{
\item catToDummy - Transform categorical variables to numerical values
either using dummy variables or by using Empirical
Logit. If the value is 1, transformation is done using
dummy variables, else if the value is 0,
transformation is done using Empirical Logit.
\item performNorm - 0/1 indicating whether to perform standardization of data.
\item performVarReduc - 0/1. If the value is 1,
the stored procedure eliminates variables based on standard deviation and
correlation.
\item makeDataSparse - If 0,Retains zeroes and NULL values
from the input table. If 1, Removes zeroes and NULL. If 2,Removes zeroes 
but retains NULL values.
\item minStdDev - Minimum acceptable standard deviation for
elimination of variables. Any variable that has a
standard deviation below this threshold is
eliminated. This parameter is only consequential if
the parameter PerformVarReduc = 1. Must be >0.
\item maxCorrel - Maximum acceptable absolute correlation between
a pair of columns for eliminating variables. If the
absolute value of the correlation exceeds this
threshold, one of the columns is not transformed.
Again, this parameter is only consequential if the
parameter PerformVarReduc = 1. Must be >0 and <=1.
\item classSpec - list describing the categorical dummy variables.
Should include the reference value for each column in the list.
\item whereconditions - takes the where_clause as a string to subset rows.
\item excludeCols character vector specifying columns to be excluded from Analysis.
 Can also be deduced from the formula object.

\description{
The matchit function wraps all steps for a matchit analysis:
1) data prep, if a wide table is provided.
2) logistic regression
3) propensity score matching
4) matchit
All steps are done in-database with DB Lytix.
}
\details{
The function returns a list with the logistic regression model,
a FLSimpleVector with the propensities
FLSimpleVector with discarded obsids,
and a closure function whereClause for restricting
a FLTable or FLVector to the matched set for further statistical analyses.
