\title{Perform matchit algorithm in database.}
\usage{
matchit(formula, data, method = "nearest", distance = "logit",
  distance.options = list(), discard = "none", reestimate = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{This argument takes the usual syntax of R formula,
‘treat ~ x1 + x2’, where ‘treat’ is a binary treatment
indicator and ‘x1’ and ‘x2’ are the pre-treatment covariates.
Both the treatment indicator and pre-treatment covariates must
be contained in the same data frame, which is specified as
‘data’ (see below). No operators in formulas are currently
supported in AdapteR.}

\item{data}{This argument specifies the data frame containing the
variables called in ‘formula’. Either a FLTable or prepared
data in a deep table.}

\item{method}{(for API compatibility with MatchIt, must be
nearest)}

\item{distance}{(for API compatibility with MatchIt, must be
logit)}

\item{distance.options}{(for API compatibility with MatchIt,
ignored)}

\item{discard}{(for API compatibility with MatchIt, must be none)}

\item{reestimate}{(for API compatibility with MatchIt, not
supported)}
}
\description{
The function returns a FLSimpleVector discarded
}
