\title{Logarithms and Exponentials of in-database objects.}
\usage{
\S4method{exp}{FLMatrix}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{can be an in-database object like FLMatrix,FLVector or
a normal R object}

\item{base}{a positive number with respect to which logs are computed}
}
\value{
returns an in-database object if there is atleast one in-database object 
as input.Otherwise, the default behavior of R is preserved
}
\description{
Element-wise Logarithms and Exponentials of in-database objects.
}
\details{
All types of operands are possible just like in R 
and the result is an in-database object.
\code{exp} computes the exponential function.
\code{log} computes the logarithm to base as specified(default e).
\code{logb} computes the logarithm to base as specified(default e).
\code{log1p} computes the log10(1+x) accurately (also for |x| << 1).
\code{log10} computes the logarithm to base 10.
\code{log2} computes the logarithm to base 2.
\code{expm1} computes exp(x)-1 accurately (also for |x| << 1).
\code{sqrt} computes the (principal) square root of x, âˆš{x}. The naming follows
the standard for computer languages such as C or Fortran.
