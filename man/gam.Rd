\title{Generalized Additive Models}
\usage{
gam(formula, family = stats::gaussian, data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An R formula object with smooth terms \code{s},
\code{te}. In these smooth terms, \code{m} and \code{k} are specified which
represent splineDegree and number of knots respectively.In
addition, NumOfPredPts is specified through \code{xt} and byVarName
through \code{by}.One Can club Spline terms with same set of
specifications by passing more than one variables/colnames in \code{s}.}

\item{family}{currently only stats::poisson is supported}

\item{data}{an object of class FLTable, must be a wide table}

\item{...}{other arguments as in mgcv::gam may be passed
but not currently used}

\item{offset}{column name indicating the offset if any}

\item{maxiter}{maximum num of iterations}
}
\value{
\code{gam} returns a list and replicates equivalent R output
from \code{mgcv::gam}.
}
\description{
\code{gam} Fits a generalized additive model
 to data given by FLTable object.
}
\section{Constraints}{

Plotting is not available. The result Set may not include all
results as in mgcv::gam. Only print and predict methods are defined.
