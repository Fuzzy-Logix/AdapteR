## Fuzzy Logix DB Lytix(TM)
## is a high-speed in-database analytics library
## written in C++, exposing ~700 functions through SQL.
## SQL as low-level language makes analyses
## consumable from all SQL-enabled clients.

## This demo shows how the
## AdapteR package of Fuzzy Logix is
## providing transparent matrix algebra with
## the DB Lytix(TM) in-database library.
